# Bonus work

I added an interesting feature in all my product details pages - I made
functionality for a "Pick for me!" button for the glazing, which randomly picks
a glazing for the customer. I've added bun selection functionality to all the 
different product details pages as well, with the page changing the price with 
different amount selections. If you add an item to the cart, you can actually
go back to the "our buns" page and select another bun and add it to cart - the
number of items in the cart stays the same and changes accordingly.

The cart also adjusts its total price according to the items in the cart, and
calculates taxes. The dropdowns to change item features appear when you hover
over them (although they don't change the items specifically). The dropdown
includes features that are not currently selected.
